# Info
I made this to test out voice recognition with React and Browser. you can change the the `src/util/data.json` to suit questions and answer database right now I have it setup for HAM test question for ham radio. 

# Install
```Bash
npm instal || npm i
npm run dev
```

# Run
nav to `localhost:5173"select the desired data bank from the drop down, click the start listing button( you may have to approve the browser permission to use mic) and each time you press the space bar it will listen to the mic input search for the question and display it, it stops listening until you press space bar again and you are ready to search for another question.
