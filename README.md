# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Install
```Bash
npm instal || npm i
npm run dev
```

# Run
nav to `localhost:5173"select the desired data bank from the drop down, click the start listing button( you may have to approve the browser permission to use mic) and each time you press the space bar it will listen to the mic input search for the question and display it, it stops listening until you press space bar again and you are ready to search for another question.
